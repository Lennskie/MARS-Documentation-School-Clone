# M.A.R.S - Mars Active Response System
Group project by Frédéric Goosens, Lenn Crochart, Caspar Nuël, Jorge David Garcia Prada and Stef Wauters

## General information
### History
The Mars Corporate War began when rival megacorps used their finances and military muscle to fight over buying out a company and its vital resources. 

In early 2040, AQUAMARS, a megacorp that specialized in underwater shipping and tech, went bankrupt, which lead to two rival aquacorps, NESTLE and RED BULL, 
squaring off for a hostile takeover of AQUAMARS's remaining assets. 

At first, both corporations engaged in the typical opening rounds of corporate battle; stock manipulations and economic warfare, but as the conflict grew out of hand, it was only a matter of time before true fighting broke out.

### Concept
The potentially hazardous environment of business operations in a dark dystopian Mars, and The Mars Corporate War established there means that emergency management and response planning are critical to the health and safety of the workers of any company.

We are M.A.R.S. (Mars Active Response System). Our domain is based on IoT and Industrial Security solutions. We provide 24/7 emergency aerial vehicle dispatch with a reflex always-ready pilot, armed safety experts, and military-trained paramedics.

A client's health is monitored by a device we put on them, and if a client takes a turn for the worse, an aerial vehicle squad receives their GPS signal and arrives on the scene in minutes. Reaction time and additional perks are dependent on the client's insurance package.
